# ServiceInspector

Allows for the calling of a webservice without the need for a web reference in your project. This code originally came from a project on [CodeProject.com](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/18950/Dynamic-Discovery-and-Invocation-of-Web-Services) by [Ehsan Golkar](https://www.codeproject.com/Members/Ehsan-Golkar), I have just made the code more genric and less wired to his GUI.
